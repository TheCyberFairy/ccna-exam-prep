# Day 3 Lab – Review Practice

## Goal
Strengthen understanding of previous topics, practice binary conversion, and begin reinforcing Cisco IOS commands.

---

## Labs Attempted
1. **Decimal to Binary Practice**  
   - Converted multiple decimal numbers into binary (e.g., 35 → 00100011, 72 → 01001000).  
   - Verified correctness through repetition.

2. **OSI & TCP/IP Scenarios**  
   - Mapped out how sending an email travels through OSI layers.  
   - Applied the same thought process to streaming video (e.g., Netflix).

3. **Packet Tracer Basics**  
   - Reopened Cisco Packet Tracer.  
   - Explored interface and placed a few generic devices to practice navigation.

4. **Cisco IOS Command Reinforcement (Planned/Placeholder)**  
   - Watched video [How To Network – Cisco IOS Commands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQAbfuPgOE&ab_channel=howtonetwork).  
   - No hands-on lab work yet, but prepared to revisit commands like `enable`, `configure terminal`, and `show` commands.  
   - Will return later to log direct practice.

## Reflection
- I noticed progress in binary conversion — it’s less intimidating now.  
- Review labs reinforced my memory of OSI/TCP/IP concepts.  
- Packet Tracer feels more natural each time I use it.  
- For Cisco IOS commands, I see improvement through external resources, but hands-on repetition will be key to mastery.
