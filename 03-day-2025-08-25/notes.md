# Day 3 – Review and Binary Conversion Milestone

## Topics Covered
- Reviewed OSI Model, TCP/IP Stack, Cisco IOS basics
- Refreshed on Transport Layer (TCP/UDP, headers, ports)
- Revisited Packet Tracer setup and basic navigation
- Light introduction to the Network Layer (IP addresses) but held off for now
- Reinforced Cisco IOS commands through external video

---

## Key Takeaways
- Review days are valuable to reinforce concepts before moving forward.
- I now feel more comfortable with:
  - Layer numbering in the OSI model
  - Differences between OSI and TCP/IP stacks
  - The purpose of Cisco IOS modes
  - How TCP vs UDP apply in real-world situations
- Achieved a **personal milestone**: successfully converting decimals to binary, which is essential for subnetting and IP addressing later.
- Watched a video to strengthen retention of Cisco IOS commands: [How To Network – Cisco IOS Commands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQAbfuPgOE&ab_channel=howtonetwork).

## Personal Takeaway
Today felt like a **reset and consolidation**. Instead of rushing into new content, I took time to review everything I’ve studied so far. The big win was finally **grasping decimal-to-binary conversion** — something I initially found confusing.  

I also peeked into the **Network Layer** and IP addressing, but I’m intentionally holding off until I feel even more solid with the earlier layers. This approach helps me build a strong foundation instead of stacking shaky knowledge.  

For Cisco IOS, I recognized that retention comes through repetition. The additional video I watched will be a go-to resource when I need to refresh IOS commands. Even though this section remains a challenge, I see improvement by mixing Udemy lessons, YouTube reinforcement, and review practice.

## Terms to Remember
- **Decimal to Binary Conversion:** Translating numbers between base 10 and base 2.  
- **OSI/TCPIP Review:** Using both models as troubleshooting frameworks.  
- **Cisco IOS Modes:** User EXEC, Privileged EXEC, Global Configuration, Interface Configuration.

## Quick Quiz (Self-Check)
1. Which OSI layer is responsible for logical addressing?  
2. Convert decimal 156 into binary.  
3. What port number is used by SSH?  
4. Which TCP/IP layer combines OSI’s Session, Presentation, and Application?  
5. Why are review sessions important in a learning journey?
