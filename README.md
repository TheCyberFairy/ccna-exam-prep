# CCNA Study Sessions

This repository follows my progress through a Udemy CCNA (200-301) course. Each folder represents a course section or study session. Inside each folder are my **notes** (summarizing key concepts) and **labs** (hands-on practice with Packet Tracer, Wireshark, or CLI).

## 🎯 Goals

- Complete daily study sessions (60-day plan).
- Document notes and labs consistently.
- Practice subnetting and CLI commands daily.
- Build a full study portfolio before the CCNA exam.
