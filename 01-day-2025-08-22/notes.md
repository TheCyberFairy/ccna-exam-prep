# Day 1 – Introduction to Networking

## Topics Covered
- Overview of networking basics
- The OSI Model (7 layers)
- The TCP/IP Stack (4 layers)
- Upper vs Lower OSI layers
- Cisco’s view of networking layers
- Installed Cisco Packet Tracer for labs

## Key Takeaways
- Networking is about devices communicating and sharing data across mediums (wired or wireless).
- The **OSI Model** is a 7-layer framework: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application.
- The **TCP/IP Stack** simplifies this into 4 layers: Network Interface, Internet, Transport, Application.
- **Upper layers** (Session, Presentation, Application) handle application-level communication.  
- **Lower layers** (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport) handle the actual delivery of data.
- Cisco often focuses on practical groupings (like Access, Distribution, and Core layers) rather than just theory.

## Personal Takeaway
I already had some familiarity with the OSI model, but going deeper helped me connect it to real-world scenarios.  
- I practiced mapping things like **sending an email** or **streaming a Netflix video** to the different OSI layers.  
- What was newer to me was the **TCP/IP stack**, and I now see how it is more relevant in real-world networking compared to the purely theoretical OSI model.  
- I also learned that in the workplace, networking problems are often referenced by their OSI **layer number** — which makes the OSI model useful as a kind of “hypothesis” framework for troubleshooting.

## Terms to Remember
- **PDU (Protocol Data Unit):** The name of data at different OSI layers (bits, frames, packets, segments).  
- **Encapsulation:** Wrapping data with protocol information as it moves down the OSI layers.  
- **Cisco Packet Tracer:** A simulation tool for practicing networking without physical gear.

## Quick Quiz (Self-Check)
1. How many layers are in the OSI model?  
2. Which OSI layer deals with logical addressing (IP)?  
3. Which TCP/IP layer combines Session, Presentation, and Application from OSI?  
4. What’s the main difference between upper and lower OSI layers?
